# Telemetry library, management/analysis console

The usual cmake/make/make install.

# Server

Requires PHP >= 5.5 and Sqlite, MySQL or PostgreSQL, Apache with SSL set up.

- copy src/server to your webserver (alternatively, use "make deploy")
- set up authentication for the analytics sub-folder
- rename config/localconfig.php.example to config/localconfig.php and adjust
  settings in there based on your database setup
- start UserFeedbackConsole, connect to the server, that will trigger the database
  creation

## Local Development

The following setup works locally without the need of a full webserver with SSL and authentication
setup. It's also used by the automated tests.

- configure database access via src/server/config/localconfig.php as described above
- in src/testserver, run: 'php -S localhost:1984 router.php'
- connect via UserFeedbackConsole to trigger database setup
