 * @mainpage User Feedback Framework
 * @section User Feedback
 * Framework for collecting feedback from application users. This currently consists of two aspects:
 *  - Telemetry
 *  - Surveys
 *
 * @section Telemetry
 *  - Extensible set of data sources for telemetry.
 *  - Full control for the user on what data to contribute.
 *
 * @section Surveys
 *  - Distribute surveys and offer users to participate in them.
 *  - Allow the user to configure how often they want to participate in surveys.
 *
 * @section Integration
 *  To use this framework in your application, on a high level you have to do
 *  the following steps inside your program:
 *   - Create an instance of KUserFeedback::Provider for the entire lifetime of your
 *     application, and configure it as described in its documetation.
 *   - Add one or more data sources to the provider, choosing from the standard
 *     built-in ones, or by adding custom ones deriving from KUserFeedback::AbstractDataSource.
 *   - Add a way to notify your users about surveys, and to encourage them to contriubute
 *     in the first place, by hooking a suitable user interface up with the corresponding
 *     signals in UserFeedback::Provider. KUserFeedback::NotificationPopup provides a
 *     reference widget for this purpose.
 *   - Add a way for your users to configure what data to contribute, and how often
 *     to be bothered by surveys. KUserFeedback::FeedbackConfigDialog provides a
 *     reference implementation of a configuration dialog for this.
